Project Link : http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html

Sections Of the Project Covered are:

Search: Implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

Multi-Agent Search: Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.
